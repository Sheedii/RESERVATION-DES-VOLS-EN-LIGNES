# TCP Server-Client and Multi-threaded Socket Programming in Python

## 1. TCP Server-Client Implementation

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is well-suited for applications requiring high reliability. It is commonly used by protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, and Telnet. TCP ensures:
- Reliable data transfer, guaranteeing data integrity and order of delivery.
- Flow control, requiring a three-way handshake to establish a connection before sending data.
- Error checking and recovery with retransmission of erroneous packets.
- Congestion control to maintain stability.

### Features of TCP:
- Rearranges data packets in the correct order.
- Ensures data remains intact during transfer.
- Handles reliability and flow control.

## 2. Multi-threaded Socket Programming

### Prerequisites:
- **Socket Programming in Python**
- **Multi-threading in Python**

### What is Socket Programming?
Socket programming facilitates communication between a client and a server:
- **Client**: Sends and receives messages.
- **Server**: Listens and processes data from the client.

### What is a Thread?
A **thread** is a lightweight, memory-efficient process that is cheaper to use than a traditional process.

### What is Multi-threading in Socket Programming?
Multi-threading allows multiple threads to run simultaneously within a single process. In Python, the `_thread` and `threading` modules provide tools for thread synchronization, locking, and concurrent execution.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Lock Object**: Used to prevent resource conflicts during multi-threading.
  - States: **"locked"** and **"unlocked"**.
  - Methods:
    - `acquire()`: Locks the resource.
    - `release()`: Unlocks the resource.
- **Thread Creation**: The `thread.start_new_thread()` function starts a new thread with:
  - A target function.
  - A tuple of arguments for the function.

### Code Example:
This repository includes a sample implementation of a multi-threaded socket program with Python 3.

## Usage Instructions:

### Server:
Run the server script:
```bash
python server.py
```

### Client:
Run the client script:
```bash
python client.py
```

### Simulation Setup:
- **Machine 1**: PC running Windows.
- **Machine 2**: Virtual Machine running Linux.
